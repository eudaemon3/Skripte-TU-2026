# 📘 Skripte-TU-2026

This repo is a small collection of scripts I wrote during my university courses (2025–2026).  
They include quick plots, visualizations, and other small helpers I used to solve and understand various exercises.  

Most scripts are written in **Python** with **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**, and are meant to be short, clear, and easy to tweak.
